## Part 2 â€“ Reflection

In the second half of this quarter, I have learned how to use the grep command, which has transformed the way I handle large sets of data. The grep command is highly useful for efficiently searching and extracting specific text patterns from files in my lab. With it, I can quickly find the file I need.

Vim has also proven to be invaluable. I can utilize the Vim command to locate specific files from a vast number of Java files, view them, and make modifications directly in the terminal. Prior to this, I had never used Vim in such a manner . Following these labs, I have gained some proficiency in using Vim to modify my code.

Additionally, in this class, I learned effective team task management. When dealing with numerous files, I can now make code modifications, save the changes, and upload the code, allowing others to easily review my modifications. This skill has proven to be extremely useful.
